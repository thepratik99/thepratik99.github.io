                &emsp; According to LA's weather history, there are high chances of rain in winter, from December to
                March. Thus, the average number of trips per day decreases in that time period. However, the average
                duration of a trip does not change that much. As we can see in the graph, the number of trips done by
                Walk-ups is pretty close to the number of trips done by Monthly pass holders from August to October.
                After that, we can see a decrease in the number of trips done by Monthly pass holders from November to
                March. On the other hand, the number of trips done by walk-ups changes with the same pattern as total
                trips from November to March. Change in the number of trips done by Flex pass users has a similar
                pattern to the total trips.

                &emsp; According to the graph above, only about 5% of the trips done by Monthly pass or flex pass
                holders are Round trips. People who purchase a Monthly pass or a Flex pass tend to use the bike share
                as a part of their regular commute. Thus, they always make one-way trips from their home to work and
                vice-versa. On the other hand, about 20% of the trips done by walk-ups are Round trips. One way trips
                cost more money to the company because they have to transport bikes from station to station in order to
                make sure that there are enough bikes at every station. Round trips start and end at the same station.
                If the company makes a round trip cheaper than a one way trip for walk-ups, it can increase the
                percentage of round trips done by walk-ups.
